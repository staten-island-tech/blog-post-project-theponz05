    <h4 class="body-header"> A Rich Snob's Favorite Pizza 
    </h4>
    <p class="body-main"> 
        Hello, I am a rich person snob. I only eat the highest quality of food, 
        and I will not eat anything a dirty commoner would eat. Pizza is some of my favorite food, 
        but I would never, and I mean never, eat a pizza that costs under 500 bucks. 
        My favorite pizza is lined with gold flakes. Once, a horrifying occurrence happened to me.
        I was flying on my private jet to an expensive pizza place halfway across the country.
        Once I made it there, I ordered my favorite pizza, the $2,000 pizza, but they said they
        were out! Horrifying! I had to order normal people pizza for $50 and as I bit into it, 
        I threw up in my mouth, and nearly threw up all over the table. From then, I vowed to 
        never eat food that costs under 500 bucks.

    </h4>
    <p class="body-main-2"> 
        It is me, rich snob again. Let me tell you about my second favorite food, golden steak. 
        Steak is great but only if it is wrapped in gold sheets. I would never eat normal steak. 
        It needs to be flavored with gold to taste good. One time, my friend invited me over, and get
        this, he served regular steak!! I said to him “How can you eat that stuff?”, he responded 
        saying that he thought I liked steak, and I told him that the only way it would taste good 
        is with gold. He told me to just try it and as soon as I put it in my mouth, I fell over 
        from how bad it tasted. As you can see, I have terrible experiences with food and you should feel sorry for me even though I am a multimillionaire.

    </h4>
    <p class="body-main-3">
        Rich snob here for the final time. Let me tell you about hamburgers. They are bad, 
        unless- you guessed it- they have gold flakes on them. Regular burgers look putrid, 
        unless they have gold on them. My story about hamburgers is when I went to a new place 
        with expensive hamburgers, I ordered a hamburger with golden flakes. When I got my 
        burger there were only a couple golden flakes, and when I bit into it I could tell 
        it was low quality gold. “WHAT IS THIS STUFF?” I screamed. The server told me that 
        high quality gold was too expensive to put on a burger. I was so upset that I threw 
        the burger at the server and screamed “THIS PLACE STINKS!” and ran out the door.
